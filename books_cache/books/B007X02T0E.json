  "description": "Winner of the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award for Nonfiction\n\nFinalist for the Lionel Gelber Prize and the Kiriyama Pacific Rim Book Prize\n\nEmbracing Defeat is John W. Dower's brilliant examination of Japan in the immediate, shattering aftermath of World War II.\n\nDrawing on a vast range of Japanese sources and illustrated with dozens of astonishing documentary photographs, Embracing Defeat is the fullest and most important history of the more than six years of American occupation, which affected every level of Japanese society, often in ways neither side could anticipate. Dower, whom Stephen E. Ambrose has called \"America's foremost historian of the Second World War in the Pacific,\" gives us the rich and turbulent interplay between West and East, the victor and the vanquished, in a way never before attempted, from top-level manipulations concerning the fate of Emperor Hirohito to the hopes and fears of men and women in every walk of life. Already regarded as the benchmark in its field, Embracing Defeat is a work of colossal scholarship and history of the very first order.",
